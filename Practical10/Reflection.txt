Generally, it was quite hard. For example, when programming SIR.py, I did'nt realize to use sum() before
np.random.choice() because I did'nt know what no.random.choice() would return until I tried to print it.
Besides, when dealing with vaccination_SIR.py, I did'nt know to create a new list to store the results under
each vaccination rates, and it took me some effort to use enumerate() to plot all these results on the same
graph by searching the Internet for assistance. What's more, the hardest part must be Spatial_SIR.py but I did
enjoy this task a bit more than other tasks. That's becuase it took geographical factors into account, which is
quite relavent with the COVID-19 pandemic. From this practical, I learned to carefully think through before 
recklessly begining typing. Additionally, searching the Internet for essential help maybe useful when handling 
with difficult tasks.

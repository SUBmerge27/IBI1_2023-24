Changes I have made after receiving feedback:
1. In Practical4 mystery code, I added "between 1 and 10" to specify the random numbers between 1 and 10.
2. In Practical4 culture density, I added if a<=90 before n+=1 to avoid incorrect increasing of holiday days. Besides, I provided more explaination for what the n variable means because the feedback said that I had provided wrong explaination in formative code submission.
3. In Practical6 average day, I added a revisable variable to represent the activity requested by the user and printed the correct number of hours spent on that activity, which was nonexistent in formative code submission.

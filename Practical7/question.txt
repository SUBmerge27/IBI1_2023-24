My question: How has the DALYs changed in the UK over time? 
answer line number:34
discuss the result:it generally fits what i expected. The DALY of uk keeps decreasing 
from 1990 to around 2014, this may beacause of the development of medicine.
However,after 2014, it keeps fluctuating, which can be explained that typical diseases
such as Arthritis and Asthma can not be cured thoroughly without causing harm.
Also, the unhealthy life habits can be attributed.

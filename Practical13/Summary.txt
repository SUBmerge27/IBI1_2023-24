Human vs Mouse alignment score: 3137.0, percentage of identical amino acids: 0.9253968253968254
Human vs Rat alignment score: 3107.0, percentage of identical amino acids: 0.9174603174603174
Mouse vs Rat alignment score: 3261.0, percentage of identical amino acids: 0.9682539682539683

Given these results, mouse and rat are most closely related, because as the protocol says:"
positive log-odds scores indicate that the event is	more likely	than it	would be under the null	model."
Therefore, a higher positive score means that this substitution is more common in natural evolution than random probability.
The results show that Mouse vs Rat has a ralatively higher alignment score and  higher percentage of identical amino acids.

Given the same reason mentioned above, mouse is a better model organism for human than rat, because
Human vs Mouse shows a higher percentage of identical amino acids and a bigger alignment scoreas than those of Human vs Rat.
